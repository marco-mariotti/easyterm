Installation

We recommend to use the conda package manager to install easyterm
(check `this page to install conda / miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_).
With conda installed, **run this in a terminal to install easyterm**::

  conda install -c mmariotti easyterm

Alternatively, you can use pip::

  pip install easyterm

To check that installation was successful, run this::
	  
  python -c 'import easyterm'
